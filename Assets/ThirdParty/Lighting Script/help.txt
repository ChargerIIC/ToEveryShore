Supports Free and Pro Unity Version!
Demo: http://www.3y3.net/HighLight/ObjectHighlihtSystem.html

The Object Highlight System allows any user to easy add lighting and label display to any object in three simple steps. It is ideal for Point&Click games, supports any object including complex parent-child prefabs and it is highly configurable.

Step 1)
Add a box collider to the desired object. Make sure the 'Is Trigger' option is NOT set.

Step 2)
Add the highlight script to the object

Step 3)
Set the script values to match your desired behavior. There are many options, most of them optional.

SCRIPT OPTIONS
Highlight Shader: Set the desired shader or leave the default one.
Player: Character transform. If set, the object highlight only when the character is at desired minimun distance
Light Distance: Minimun distance to highlight the object
Label Distance: Minimun distance to show the label
Label to Display: Text to show when highlighted
Label Color: Text color
Outlined: Set ON if you wish the text to have an outline.
Outline Color: Text outline color
Text font: Use desired font or leave y default (arial)
Font Size: Text size of the label
Animation Clip: Animation to play when highlighted (can be null)

IMPORTANT!! Do you see an ugly pink highlight when export your scene? This is because the used shader is not present in the exported project. Simply add a hidden object (i.e. a quad) and apply a material with the used highlight shader (by default is "Self-Illumin/Diffuse")
